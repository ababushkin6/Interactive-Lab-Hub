## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

The red wire is power, the brown is ground and the orange wire is the data connection to the arduino.

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

The servo should be attached to signal pin 9 of the arduino. 

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

The parts of the code that control the servo angle is the pos variable and the limits are determines in the for loops of the code. The speed is determined by both the delay amount inside the for loop as well as the step-size to increase or decrease the position.
    

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**
